<h2>Your Bevgo Account is Pending Activation</h2>

<p>Hi <%= companyName %>,</p>

<p>
Thanks for completing your Bevgo onboarding! Your account has been created successfully,
but it still needs to be activated by our team before you can place orders.
</p>

<p>
This is usually because your account requires additional verification or credit approval.
Once everything is reviewed, you’ll receive an update immediately.
